## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Integrate MusicBrainz metadata API for Music media type, similar to how TMDB integration works for Films and TV shows. MusicBrainz (musicbrainz.org) is a comprehensive music metadata database that provides release information, cover art, and track listings.

This integration will enable automatic metadata fetching for music releases including cover art, track lists, and release details.

**User Value:** Users can automatically fetch accurate metadata for their music media backups, including official cover art and complete track listings, making it easier to organize and browse their music collection.
